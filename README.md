# WhatsApp Chat Analyzer
Overview

Welcome to the WhatsApp Chat Analyzer project! This Python application, combined with the power of Streamlit, allows you to gain valuable insights into your WhatsApp group chats. Whether you're a community manager, group admin, or just curious about your chat dynamics, this tool provides a user-friendly interface to analyze various aspects of your chat.

Key Features

1. Most Active User Analysis: Identify and highlight the most active participant in your chat.

2. Total Message Count: Quickly obtain an overview of the chat's activity with the total number of messages sent.



The project is a work in progress, and I have exciting plans for future updates:

1. False Language Analysis:  Detect and analyze messages containing false or inappropriate language.

2. Community Guidelines Compliance: Identify and analyze group members who may not be following community guidelines.
